# Product Guidelines: 52 Projects Tracker

## User Experience (UX) Principles
- **Efficiency First:** The interface should minimize the friction between wanting to update a status and completing the action.
- **Clarity of Status:** The user should be able to instantly distinguish between projects that are done, in progress, or pending.
- **Distraction-Free:** Since this is a personal productivity tool, avoid unnecessary animations or complex navigation.

## Visual Identity
- **Dark Mode Aesthetic:** The primary theme will be a dark, developer-centric palette to reduce eye strain and provide a modern feel.
- **Minimalist UI:** Focus on a clean, grid-based or list-based layout with clear typography and subtle accents to denote status.

## Tone and Messaging
- **Minimalist & Functional:** Text should be concise and utilitarian. The UI should stay out of the way, providing information only when needed.
